  This is an example snippet leveraging sub-directory
  structures within snippets. This file will export
  with the directory name prefixed to it as per our
  configuration in the syncify.config.ts file, e.g:

  The output will be:

  themes/snippets/example-foo.liquid

  You can mark all files in this directory as pass-through
  globs by passing the directory name to the views > snippets > globs
  option in the syncify.config.ts file.
